## Why do you need to pay for the steamAPI RestartAppIfNecessary function?
 
The steamAPI RestartAppIfNecessary function is not free by default because it requires a license from Valve, the company that owns and operates Steam. Valve charges a fee for using the Steamworks API, which varies depending on the type and size of the game or application. The fee covers the cost of hosting, bandwidth, maintenance, and support for the Steam platform. Valve also takes a cut from the sales of the game or application on Steam.
 
## Is it legal to use the steamAPI RestartAppIfNecessary function for free?
 
The answer to this question is not clear-cut, as it depends on the terms and conditions of Valve and the game or application developer. Using the steamAPI RestartAppIfNecessary function for free may violate the intellectual property rights of Valve or the game or application developer, as well as the Steam Subscriber Agreement and the Steamworks Developer Agreement. These agreements prohibit modifying, reverse engineering, or distributing any part of the Steamworks API without authorization. Therefore, using the steamAPI RestartAppIfNecessary function for free may result in legal action from Valve or the game or application developer.
